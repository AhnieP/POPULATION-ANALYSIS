# POPULATION-ANALYSIS (POWER BI)  ![Population Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/group-foreground-selected.png) 
A data-driven project focused on analyzing demographic, behavioral, and health-related factors across U.S. states and territories to uncover health disparities, track chronic conditions, and inform public health strategies using Power BI.
# üìä Population Analysis Analysis

### Project Report

---

## üìö 1. Overview

This project leverages healthcare datasets to understand population health risks, identify disparities, and support data-driven public health strategies. The primary focus is on population analysis‚Äîevaluating demographic and behavioral factors affecting general and chronic health across the U.S. and its territories.

---

## üèõÔ∏è 2. Purpose of the Analysis

The goal of the population analysis is to uncover patterns in health outcomes using demographic, behavioral, and clinical data. Insights drawn will help inform public health policies, preventive care programs, and strategic healthcare planning.

---

## üìñ  3. Background

Modern healthcare demands data-driven decision-making to improve outcomes, reduce disparities, and allocate resources effectively. By understanding relationships between health behaviors (e.g., smoking), chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes), and social determinants, we can identify at-risk populations and recommend targeted interventions.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è 4. Scope of the Analysis

- **Demographics:** Age, sex, race/ethnicity  
- **Behaviors:** Smoking, alcohol, physical activity  
- **Health Status:** Chronic diseases, mental and physical health days  
- **Preventive Care:** Vaccinations, screenings  
- **BMI and Risk:** Obesity-related outcomes  
- **Geography:** Health disparities across states/territories  

---

## üéØ 5. Key Objectives

- Understand demographic impacts on physical and mental health  
- Analyze lifestyle behaviors contributing to poor health outcomes  
- Evaluate prevalence and impact of chronic conditions  
- Assess healthcare utilization (vaccinations, screenings)  
- Identify state-level disparities in health  
- Recommend evidence-based interventions  

---

## üåê 6. Data Sources

Data is derived from publicly accessible U.S. government health surveillance databases, covering populations across US states and territories.

| `Chronic Conditions`    | Heart attack, stroke, asthma, diabetes, etc. |
| `Lifestyle Factors`     | Smoking, drinking, physical activity |
| `Preventive Services`   | Flu shot, HIV test, Tdap vaccine |
| `BMI`                   | Body mass index derived from height/weight |
| `Demographics`          | Age, sex, race/ethnicity |

## üßπ 8.  Data Cleaning and Preparation

Performed in **Power BI**:
- Validated field types  
- Addressed outliers/inconsistencies  
- Optimized data model for DAX and visualization  

---

## üìå 9. Key Measures and Insights

### ü©∫ General Health by Age and Sex
- Older populations show poorer general health and higher chronic disease burden.
- Gender disparities noted in physical vs. mental health experiences.

### üí® Health Behavior Analysis
- Smoking and vaping linked to poor respiratory and mental health outcomes.
- Physical inactivity correlates with increased physical health complaints.

### üíâ Preventive Care Uptake
- Higher flu vaccination and HIV screening rates associate with better overall health.
- Low vaccination states are prime targets for awareness campaigns.

### ‚öñÔ∏è BMI and Health Risk
- Elevated BMI strongly linked with diabetes, arthritis, and lower general health scores.
- Overweight individuals benefit from targeted wellness interventions.

## ‚úÖ 11. Dashboard

## üìä Dashboard Overview

The **Population Analysis Dashboard** provides a comprehensive view of health patterns across demographic segments. Built using Power BI, it enables dynamic filtering by **Age Category**, **Sex**, **Race**, **Disability Status**, and **State**, empowering users to uncover population health disparities and risk profiles.

### üßæ Key Sections:

- **Demographics Panel**  
  Displays total population size (246K) with gender distribution (Male: 48%, Female: 52%).

- **Chronic Conditions by Age Category**  
  Visualizes the prevalence of chronic diseases, highest among older adults (65+).

- **Health Metrics by Lifestyle**  
  - **Mental Health Days by Smoking & Alcohol Use**  
    Highlights higher mental health burden among current smokers and alcohol users.
  - **Physical Activity vs. Health**  
    Shows better physical and mental health days among active individuals.

- **Vaccination Rates by Health Metrics**  
  Illustrates trends across general health categories, with improved uptake among healthier groups.

- **General & Mental Health by Age and Sex**  
  - Females report slightly worse physical and mental health.
  - Younger age groups (18‚Äì34) report more general health days.

- **BMI by General Health Rating**  
  Reveals a decrease in BMI as self-rated health improves, indicating a correlation between healthy weight and positive health perception.

### üîç Interactive Filters:
- Age Category
- Race
- Sex
- Disability Status
- U.S. States

This dashboard supports **health equity analysis** and **targeted intervention planning**, helping stakeholders identify at-risk groups and design effective preventive strategies.
